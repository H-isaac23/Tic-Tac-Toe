# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is made just because I'm bored. I won't be using any online guide for creating this project, and it will be purely based on what I currently know about the game and python.

## Objectives
Here are the goals that I want to be able to do for this project.
-Make a playable game of tic-tac-toe in the console with an ai
-Show the scores of each side for each run of the program.
-Make it playable for 2 players.
-Have an account system(not a priority)
-Make a GUI(would be nice to have)

## Contribution
Ideas for improvement are welcome, just open an issue and I will take a look at the idea on whether I would implement it or not.
As for the code, I prefer doing it myself, so yeah.
